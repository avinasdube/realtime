A real-time chat application built using Nodejs and Reactjs to play around with the concepts of Web Sockets and Socket.io from basic to advance level

## Features

2. Create Room
3. Join Room
4. Send Messages

### **Note** 

This project is completely built to learn the concepts of Socket.io, like how to connect, create room, communicate, share and get details etc. It is a fun project. Anyone wanting to get started with learning Socket.io can fork and clone this project and customize it according to their own understanding. 

If you love or like this project and anyhow you get some help from it, do give it a star so someone else can find it easily and also learn.
